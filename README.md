# SE Coursework, 6th semester

This repo contains the source code for my 6th semester Software Engineering Coursework.

It is supposed to be a quite small app with Django-based web interface and two modules: one for storing texts and one for classifying them

## TODO:

- [ ] Init Django app
- [ ] Init Cassandra
- [ ] Add an ability to manage Cassandra tables via Django
- [ ] Create the classification module
- [ ] Add some sort of classification web interface
- [ ] Pack it all in Docker container
